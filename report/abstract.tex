The Image-group on DIKU currently work with a number of simulations and mesh
structures, each requiring a custom tool for visualization. It is the wish that
a new tool be created to unify the visualization process.

The design developed in this project, visMesh, is a C++ plugin for Autodesk Maya
that includes a simple virtual interface for plugging in both new simulators and
mesh structures. A prototype of the plugin was developed and tested using a
discretized 3D Chan-Vese segmentation library and the DSC mesh framework.

The prototype was tested and compared to the current OpenGL application that is
used to visualize the Chan-Vese segmentations. The comparison was based on
visualization results, CPU- and memory usage both during simulation and when
only displaying the results.

The prototype was found to solve a number of the problems with the current
OpenGL solution, amongst others: rendering simulations as films, low framerate
with complex meshes and stepping back and forth in a simulation. Since the
prototype is not feature complete, a number of improvements have been suggested
to increase the usability of the tool.\\
